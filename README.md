# Analyse of Air Quality in Dublin using IoT and Machine Learning

This project aims to process air quality data collected from sensors placed on DPD Delivery trucks in the Dublin area. This data will provide an estimation of the air quality in different parts of Dublin at different times of the day.

The sensors will collect the following information:
- Air quality
- GPS position
- Date and time of data collection
The first step is to create a map to visualize the air quality in Dublin.

Then, we aim to predict the air quality for the next three months based on historical data.
The final step in the process is to conduct a thorough analysis of the correlation between air quality and other data sources. This analysis will help to determine the relationship between air quality and other environmental factors such as traffic and events in Dublin.
